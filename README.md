# AccountsSite
A website that stores input variables for accounts into a MySql database.

This project was created for our second assignment in an Enterprise Development course at Texas State University.

Based on user inputs, this object creates a User object to be stored into a MySQL database for accounts. With this database, users can choose to input, update, or delete accounts of users based on the values they input on the homepage. When the second JSP file is displayed it should populate with all users that are currently stored in the accounts table located inside a given MySQL database.

The objective of this assignment was to learn how to utilize databases in our web applications.

# Currently, this project does not contain a Script for the created MySQL schema or table. As a result, it will not run properly unless a database with the same name is stored on a users local device.
